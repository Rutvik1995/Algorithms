1. Maximum Independent Set of a tree

Soln: Choose all leaves, remove its parents and repeat till the root is reached. To implement it, 
just do an Inorder traversal and return true or false to determine if a particular node has to be
selected or not. To prove this, we can use the 'Exchange trick'. Suppose you have an optimal solution,
by adding a leaf you can only increase the MIS or keep it the same. B'coz adding a leaf would remove its
parent and nothing else.

2. Fractional Knapsack

Soln: Let s1, s2, .... sn be the size of items, v1,v2, ... vn be the value of items. 
sum(xi*si) < B, sum(xi*vi) should be maximum. Since any fraction of an item allowed,
sort the items according the the ratio 'vi/si'. Start choosing from the highest
value of 'vi/si'.
